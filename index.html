It is a indoor outdoor school the lunch area and playground is amazing and the shed with all the boardgames, art material, hoola-hoops, and jumproaps. The music room is a just enough space, it's the same with the P.E we hardly use it. Dance crew led by a 5th grade teacher Mrs. Lack happens every Thursday we perform every holiday, and other clubs on other days. Each classroom has enough room for a desk for every student, the teacher's desk, a projector, a group table or two, and a mini library. There are a lot of parrades and events every year.</p>

<p>Fairlands Elementry host this program every October. In this program all the students k-5 and teacher are able to donate. You might be wondering ok so they donate money to the school? Well no we do not donate that we donate socks and other essentials like a jacket to the homeless. You might also be wondering why my school host's this program? The answer to that question is that in the month of October it gets cold if if you don't wear socks well you have to wear socks. But what will the people who don't have socks do? Well we will donate them socks and even other essentials to survive the harsh coldness.</p>
